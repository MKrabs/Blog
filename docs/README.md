# Domain Driven Design in Django

###### Sperrvermerk

This project is a restructuring of my existing blog site (www.mkrabs.de) using Domain Driven Design principles, as
part of the Advanced Software Engineering course in the 6th semester at the Duale Hochschule of Karlsruhe. The project
code is publicly available on GitHub, but please note that I do not take any responsibility for the use of this
code / architecture or other mishaps you might write in other projects. I cannot be held liable for any negative
outcomes or poor grades resulting from the use of this code, as it is intended for educational purposes only.
